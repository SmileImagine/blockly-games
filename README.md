Google's Blockly Games is a series of educational games that teach programming.
It is based on the [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) library.
All code is free and open source.

**The games are available at https://blockly.games/**

**The developer's site is at https://github.com/google/blockly-games/wiki**


Note: I have simply edited the ducks.js file so that the 3 bot ducks' code can be edited or replaced with user code. This enables PvP battles. I'd love if someone would host this version.
